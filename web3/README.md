# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npm i hardhat
npx hardhat 
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run ./ignition/modules/Dappazon.ts
```
